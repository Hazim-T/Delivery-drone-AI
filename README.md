# Delivery-drone-AI
A reinforcement learning project using unity to about a drone delivering parcels.


--Current tasks:
- (optional) new drone controls. so only take the models.



//- Adding skybox and world border and parcel assets.{done}

- Adding trails for each drone.



- positive rewards : {time, accuracty of drop, distance to drop zone}

- negative rewards : {collision for hitting environment and drones, going too high, parcel collides}



- It can only drop parcel at a certain Y level and a certain low speed(<1).
  
- Having multiple drones in each episode, but multiple episodes are the same time ghosting since the environment is constant.

- beside number_of_steps, add a timer to see how the drone improves.



- mechanics needed : {drop zone random generation, parcel attaching and detaching, parcel condition(number of parcel collisions mapped to conditions)
                       drone recognizing it's own parcel}
