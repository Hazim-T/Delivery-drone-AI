# Delivery-drone-AI
A reinforcement learning project using unity to about a drone delivering parcels.


--Tasks:

- (optional) new drone controls. so only take the models. [DONE]

- Adding trails for drones.

- Adding skybox and world border and parcel assets. (world border remaining)



- positive rewards : {time, accuracty of drop, distance to drop zone} [DONE]

- negative rewards : {collision for hitting environment and drones, going too high, parcel collides} [DONE]

  
- Having multiple drones in each episode, but multiple episodes are the same time ghosting since the environment is constant. (under thought)

- beside number_of_steps, add a timer to see how the drone improves. [DONE]

- mechanics needed : {drop zone random generation (under work), parcel attaching and detaching (under thought), parcel condition(number of parcel collisions mapped to conditions)[DONE]
                       drone recognizing it's own parcel(under thought)}
